# Transformer-based model for long-time dissipative quantum dynamics

In this tutorial, we use a pre-trained Transformer model to predict the time evolution of a quantum dissipative system. We focus on the spin-boson model for the symmetric case. 
The model predicts the next time step in the system's evolution given an initial trajectory.  By doing this iterative procedure we can simulate the long-time dynamics.
