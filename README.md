# Transformer-based model for long-time dissipative quantum dynamics

In this tutorial we use a pre-trained Transformer model to predit the time evolution of a quantum dissipative system. We focus on the spin-boson model forthe symmetric case. 
The model preditcs the next time step in the evolution of the system given an initial trajectory.  By doing this procedure iterative we can simulate the long time dynamics.
